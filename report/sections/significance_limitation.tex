\section{Limitations and challenges}

\begin{itemize}
\item paper does not discuss robustness of the method to the distribution assumptions
\item experiments do not cover cases where fissioned data get transformed to follow a different distribution
\item paper does not discuss how to choose tuning parameter (controlling amount of information split between $f(X)$ and $g(X)$)
\item following the previous point, this paper does not discuss the relations between having a discrete vs. continuous tuning parameter (e.g. the two different ways of fissioning exponentially distributed data in Appendix B of \cite{leiner2022data})
\item Proofs have missing terms, inaccurate notations.
\item The discrete version of data fission for Gamma data may be incorrect.
\end{itemize}
