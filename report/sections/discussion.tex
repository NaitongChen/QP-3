\section{Discussion}
Overall, in linear regression, P1 and splitting asymptotically similar, but P1 offering better performance when sample size is small, in both selection and inference. P2 is similar to P1 at selection, but inference performance is hindered by bias. To conclude, if we know variance, and have a small sample, use data fission over splitting. P1 better than P2 because no bias. Raises questions on how to deal with this randomness in P2, as it does give a framework for extending data fission to non Gaussian data.

Worth noting that these metrics appear to be highly variable. This implies that given a single instance of data fission vs. data splitting, the performance in terms of these metrics may be pretty similar, but on average, we observe the phenomenons discussed above.
